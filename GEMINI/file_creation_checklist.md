# File Creation Checklist

Before creating any new file, you must confirm the following:

- [ ] **Architectural Alignment:** Does the file's location and name conform to the structure defined in `/docs/03_Project_Architecture.md`?
- [ ] **Code Standards:** Does the new file include boilerplate that aligns with the standards mentioned in `/docs/02_Tech_Stack_Decisions.md` (e.g., React function component structure)?
- [ ] **Naming Convention:** Is the filename in the correct case (e.g., `PascalCase` for React components, `kebab-case` for others)?
- [ ] **Purpose:** Does this file have a single, clear responsibility as per the Separation of Concerns principle?
- [ ] **Documentation:** Does the file require header comments explaining its purpose?
