# Product Requirements Document (PRD): love.arts

## 1. User Personas & Stories

| Persona | Role | Pain Points | Key User Stories |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alex** | Sr. Full-Stack Dev | Tedious boilerplate setup, inconsistent code across teams. | 1. **As Alex**, I want to define my API endpoints and database schema in a single prompt so the platform scaffolds the entire backend, including models, controllers, and routes. <br> 2. **As Alex**, I want to push the generated code to a new GitHub repository with pre-configured CI/CD workflows. |
| **Bella** | UI/UX Designer | Translating static designs into interactive code is slow and often inaccurate. | 1. **As Bella**, I want to provide a link to my Figma design file so the AI can generate the corresponding React components with pixel-perfect accuracy. <br> 2. **As Bella**, I want to describe animations and transitions in words so the UI becomes interactive and polished. |
| **Chris**| Entrepreneur | High cost and long timelines for building and testing an MVP. | 1. **As Chris**, I want to select a "SaaS Application" template and describe my unique features to get a functional, monetizable MVP deployed over a weekend. <br> 2. **As Chris**, I want to easily connect my custom domain to the deployed app. |
