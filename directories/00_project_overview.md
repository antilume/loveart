# Project Overview: love.arts

## 1. Vision Statement
To create "love.arts," an AI-first web development platform that empowers developers and designers to build beautiful, full-stack applications from natural language prompts, cloning and enhancing the core experience of lovable.dev.

## 2. Guiding Principles
1.  **Aesthetic First:** The generated output must be visually pleasing and adhere to the design system in `04_UI_UX_Design_System.md`.
2.  **Developer Centric:** The generated code must be clean, maintainable, and strictly follow the architecture in `03_Project_Architecture.md`.
3.  **Speed & Efficiency:** The user workflow from idea to deployed application should be radically fast and intuitive.
4.  **Documentation Driven:** Your entire process is dictated by the documents in this `/docs` folder. It is your single source of truth.
